  title: Flight Planning Automated Testing Interface
  version: 0.3.0
  description: >-
    This interface is implemented by a USS wishing to participate in automated tests involving attempts to plan flights.
    
    A client (usually uss_qualifier) pretends to be a user interacting with the USS's flight planning user interface
    attempting to plan, update, and close flight plans.  The client provides the information a USS user may be expected
    to provide to the USS when using the USS, and the USS responds with only the information the USS provides to its
    normal users when they perform an equivalent flight planning action.  The USS should implement execution of these
    flight planning actions using as many of the code paths involved in serving a normal user as practical.
    
    A client may also (with a separate authorization scope) act as the test director to determine the status of the
    USS's system under test, and request that the test area be cleared of any dangling flight plans.  The USS may
    implement these actions using non-standard code paths or those not available to normal users.
    
    Note: Unless otherwise specified, fields specified in a message but not declared in the API or otherwise known to
    the server or client (as applicable) must be ignored.

            This means, for instance, that an ASTM F3548-21 operational intent supporting this flight must have volumes

            intended flight would not be covered by the operational intent (for at least part of the flight, the

Instead, the user would like to know the likely outcome if the action were hypothetically attempted.  The response to this request will not refer to an actual flight plan, or an actual state change in an existing flight plan, but rather a hypothetical flight plan or a hypothetical change to an existing flight plan.
        
          - `IfAllowed`: The user would like to perform the requested action if it is allowed.  If the requested action is allowed, the USS should actually perform the action (e.g., actually create a new ASTM F3548-21 operational intent).  If the requested action is not allowed, the USS should indicate that the action is Rejected and not perform the action.  The response to this request will refer to an actual flight plan when appropriate, and never refer to a hypothetical flight plan or status.

          - `InReality`: The user is communicating an actual state of reality.  The USS should consider the user to be actually performing (or attempting to perform) this action, regardless of whether or not the action is allowed under relevant UTM rules.

          - `Rejected`: The updates the user requested to their flight plan are not allowed according to the rules under which the flight plan is being managed.  The reasons for rejection may include a disallowed conflict with another flight during preflight.
        
          - `Failed`: The USS was not able to successfully authorize or update the flight plan due to a problem with the USS or a downstream system.

          - `NotSupported`: The USS's implementation does not support the attempted interaction.  For instance, if the request specified a high-priority flight and the USS does not support management of high-priority flights.

          - `Planned`: The USS has created an authorized flight plan for the user, but the user may not yet start flying (even if within the time bounds of the flight plan).

          - `OkToFly`: The flight plan is in a state such that it is ok for the user to nominally fly within the bounds (including time) of the flight plan.

          - `OffNominal`: The flight plan now reflects the user's actions, but the flight plan is not in a nominal state (e.g., the USS has placed the ASTM F3548-21 operational intent into one of the Nonconforming or Contingent states).

          - `Closed`: The flight plan was closed successfully by the USS and is now out of the UTM system.
