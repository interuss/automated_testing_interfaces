  title: Flight Planning Automated Testing Interface
  version: 0.1.0
  description: >-
    This interface is implemented by a USS wishing to participate in automated tests involving attempts to plan flights.
    
    The client (usually uss_qualifier) pretends to be a user interacting with the USS's flight planning user interface
    attempting to plan, update, and close flight plans.
    
    The client may also (with a separate authorization scope) act as the test director to determine the status of the
    USS's system under test, and request that the test area be cleared of any dangling flight plans.
    
    Note: Unless otherwise specified, fields specified in a message but not declared in the API or otherwise known to
    the server or client (as applicable) must be ignored.

            If any option other than `Planned` or `ReadyToFly` is specified, the `notes` field should be populated with the reason for the unsuccessful outcome.

              - `Planned`: The data submitted in the flight plan intent was valid and the flight plan was successfully processed by the USS and is now authorized, but the user may not yet start flying (even if within the time bounds of the flight plan).

              - `ReadyToFly`: The flight plan is ready for the operator to begin flying within the bounds (including time) of the flight plan.

              - `Rejected`: The data provided in the flight plan was invalid and/or could not be used to successfully authorize the flight.  The reason for rejection may include a disallowed conflict with another flight.

              - `Failed`: The USS was not able to successfully authorize the flight plan due to a problem with the USS or a downstream system
            
              - `NotSupported`: The USS does not support the attempted interaction.  For instance, if the request specified a high-priority flight and the USS does not support management of high-priority flights.
