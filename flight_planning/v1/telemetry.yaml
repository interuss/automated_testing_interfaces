        When this information is present and the USS supports telemetry ingestion for a flight, the USS receiving this information should enqueue these telemetry reports to be delivered to the system, as if they were coming from the user, at (or soon after) the specified times.

          description: >-
            Unique identifier for this aircraft state/telemetry.  The content of an AircraftState with a given ID must not change over time.  Therefore, if a USS has already queued an aircraft state with this ID as telemetry to be delivered, this state may be ignored.
          type: string
        timestamp:
          description: >-
            Time at which this state is valid.  This is equivalent to the time of sensor measurement, so the USS's primary system under test should not be aware of this state until after this time.

            be reflected in the BasicFlightPlanInformation.
            
            If a system accepts UAS state reports from both the operator and UAS, it is possible the reported state may
            differ between those two sources.
