    SpecificSessionID:
      description: |-
        A unique 20 byte ID intended to identify a specific flight (session) while providing a
        greater level of privacy to the operator. The first byte is the registered unique Specific Session ID
        Type maintained by a registrar (see Annex A5), and the remaining 19 bytes is the Session ID per the
        Specific Session ID Type specification.

        Initial scheme registry entries include:

        0 – reserved
        1 – Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Drone Remote Identification Protocol (DRIP) entity ID
        2 – IEEE 1609.2 HashedID8

        Expressed as a hexadecimal string of the underlying data bytes.  A recipient should ignore any dashes in this value.  If fewer than 20 bytes are specified, the remaining bytes at the end are assumed to have value 0.
